### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Farhan Toshi, currently a foreign student in Japan majoring in Digital Business & Innovation with slightly more interest in Information and Technology.

## More About Me
- I am always been a techie, starting out in the creative industry and transitioning into the realm of codes mostly in 2023.
