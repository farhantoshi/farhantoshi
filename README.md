| Projects | Description | Libraries |
| :------: | ----------- | --------- |
| [Toxic Comment Detector](https://github.com/farhantoshi/toxic_comment_group2) | Can we use pre-trained models to detect toxic comments?ðŸ”ž This is the second project I did during a Python course in college. My teammates and I took a pre-trained text classification model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/martin-ha/toxic-comment-model) and used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/youtube-toxicity-data) to train the model to detect toxic comments. (EDA, Machine Learning & AI) | pandas, transformers, datasets, torch, matplotlib, tqdm, numpy, emoji, re, sklearn, seaborn |
| [Tobacco Use Prevalence](https://github.com/farhantoshi/F23-Python-Presentation) | Does tobacco have anything to do with GDP per capita, alcohol, or gender?ðŸš¬ This is the first project I did during a Python course in college. My teammates and I gathered data from the World Bank APIs and did some EDA to further analyze the correlation between tobacco use prevalence, countries' economic state, gender, and alcohol use. (EDA) | wbdata, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy |
